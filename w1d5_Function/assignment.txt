4. When should you choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression and
why?
As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first to consider is Function Declaration syntax.

But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, 
or we need a conditional declaration, then Function Expression should be used.
