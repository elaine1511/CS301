1/ What does it mean to say JS is dynamically typed?

NO
null: is assigned by programmer to indicate no know value yet.
undefined: is the value given by the complier to variables that have not been assigned a value.

"falsy" values: 0, 0.0, NaN, "", null, and undefined    
"truthy" values: anything else

=== because it does not automatic type conversion.

console.log(typeof(x)); //object

console.log(x++);// 1
y++;
console.log(x,y);//NaN
y=false;
console.log(x<y);//false
